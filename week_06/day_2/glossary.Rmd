## Terms
Population
  Everything that your data refers to
  i.e if I was analaysing the London Marathon finishers the population would be the partcipants

Parameters
  properties

Sample
  a subset of the poplulation 
  i.e the starting wave in the race 
  (an important goal for sampling is that it should be represenative)
  I might only want to see the elite runners

Statistics.    --      (Point estimate)
  statistics **are** estimates


Sampling error
- the difference between the summary stats - the sample summary stats

Central limit theorem
-if you take _sufficently_ large samples from a poplulation, the samples will be normally 
distributed, even if the popluation isn't normally distributed 
- often 30 is enough
- but sometimes it's not

Resampling
- replicating the sampling the protocal 

Bootstrap


Sampling distribution


Standard error
